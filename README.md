# Refined Differential Expression Analysis (RDEA) #

This repo includes the code for the pipeline for refining the results of differential gene expression analysis described in [1].

### Examples ###

The repo also include jupyter notebooks for using the pipeline on two RNA-Seq gene expression data sets for identifying gene markers for mortality in pediatric sepsis and neuroblastoma.
